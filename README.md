Weeks of work came to this. An interactive, web-based, NTSC artifact previewer. This shows you what an ARS-generated signal might look like on an actual TV.

The code is hideous, and not all that fast, but it *works*.

It does *not* limit you to the ARS's hardware palette, and if you want to you can disable the scaling/letterboxing logic and get a signal of an impossible resolution.
